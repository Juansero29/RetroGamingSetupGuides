## Pre-requisites

### Mandatory

## My PC Setup

- A nice PC, my personal setup is a PC with a RTX 3080, an intel i7-10700K CPU and 16GB of RAM. Game works fine at 1440p and 60FPS (apart from car stuttering issue)

## Install

1. Download the game from one of the torrents, if you want all the DLC prefer the US version `MotorStorm Complete (BCUS98155)`. If you don't care about DLC and want the Vanilla OG experience go with `MotorStorm (BCES00006)`

1. Once finished, the game will start and installation will be completed

1. Click on "Network"
1. Then setup PSONE or PSORG servers

   1. If there's an error on first connection, then click retry, it will work after that
1. Find a lobby usually hosted by people on the discord channels and join
1. Enjoy!

### Using PSONE Servers

#### RPCN Account Creation

1. You will need to [get to the official PSONE discord channel](https://discord.com/invite/uhZuGX9)

1. If you have a PSN account, link it on the `#bots` channel so that they are more likely to accept your account creation
1. Click on `Create ticket`
1. In the ticket, send a message like this `Hey! My RPCN username is USERNAME_YOU_USED_IN_RPCN_ACCOUNT and I want to be whitelisted to play MotorStorm ðŸ™‚ Thanks`
1. Wait a couple of hours/days till you get white listed
1. Close the ticket once connection is OK

## Best settings for my PC setup

## Custom Configuration

For setting up with this settings, first create a custom configuration and reset all to default. Then apply the following values to the specified parameters in the specified windows. These are the only ones that change from the defaults. The game will then boot with this custom settings when you double-click it from the library.

## Patch Manager

I have all patches installed. Some people may prefer to keep Motion Blur, or no. Do as you like.

## Advice And Troubleshoot

### Unlocking 60fps and 4K

#### 4K

1. Click on MotorStorm > Change Custom Configuration > `GPU`
1. On the section `Resolution Scale (Disable Strict Mode)` choose your desired resolution
1. For 1440p I go with `200% (2560x1440)`, if you have the beast to run 4K, then go with `300% (3840x2160)`.

#### 60FPS

> âš  Warning! As of 29/11/2022 unlocking FPS on the game will cause that your car will stutter troughout the races! This is a compatibility issue with RPCS3 currently active. You can [follow its resolution here](https://github.com/RPCS3/rpcs3/issues/8376)

1. Right click on MotorStorm > Manage Game Patches
1. You need to check `Unlock FPS`
1. Then click on MotorStorm > Change Custom Configuration > Advanced
1. On the right-bottom side of the window you will see `VBlank Frequency` , this setting is equivalent to the MAX FPS CAP of the game
1. Set it up to your liking. With 60 or 90 are the best values.

### SCE_NP_DRM_ERROR_LICENSE_NOT_FOUND Error

- If you come accross a SCE_NP_DRM_ERROR_LICENSE_NOT_FOUND error, you will need to remove any trace of BCES00006 in your RPCS3 installation folder (ex. in all dev_hdd\* folders). this can be caused after trying to install MotorStorm Complete (BCUS98155) when you had installed base MotorStorm (BCES00006) before. If this doesn't work, try to uninstall and reinstall RPCS3 and reinstalling MotorStorm
